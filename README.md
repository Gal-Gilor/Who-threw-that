##Introduction
Athletes look to science to increase their performance. With the tremendous scientific advancements human-kind achieved, it's easy to overlook the more simplistic tools to achieve similar solutions.
The owner of the dataset, Hikmet Gumus, captured the accelerations generated by four experienced handball players performing overarm throwings by attaching an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) to the players' dominant hand's wrist. The device Hikmet Gumus attached is relatively inexpensive, thus, more easily attainable. Suppose we can predict the ball's velocity using simple measurements; if we examine the data thoroughly, we could likely deduce how to increase the athletes' performance.

##Goals
My primary goal out of this project is to gain experience working with sensory data. To my understanding, IMU's do not typically return acceleration in meters by seconds squared or angular velocity in radians; thus, this dataset is great for introductory reasons. On the other hand, I was hoping the owner had shared the unconverted raw data and the IMU's manual to convert the readings by myself to the correct units. The secondary goal is to predict the balls' velocity using wrist acceleration measurements captured by the IMU. 

##Processing
Fortunately, the accelerations and the angular velocity are already in the preferred measurement units (meters by seconds by seconds (acceleration) and radians (angular velocity). Since the owner already transformed the raw data, I assume they also calibrated the devices and that the readings are accurate.

##Data Integrity
Overall, the data is clean without missing values
